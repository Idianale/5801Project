This is the read me for project1 waterfall STV.

src ---

We haven't been able to get our code to work but with unit testing we have gotten most of each of our classes completed. (Driver, Reporter, Candidates, Candidate classes tested and completed)
Our main issue for completetion has come from our Election class which is having issues adding up votes to our candidate class.

To run the file -- use the cmake shown or download all .cpp and .h files in src folder and run the main.cpp - this will start the program.

Testing ----

Testing has been completed for 4 of the 5 classes. Each class has each of its methods tested and data files are given to show how it was done.
The template for documentation of testing is also in this folder

Documentation --

Doxygen used for documenatation
