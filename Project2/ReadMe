This is the read me for project2 agile STV program.

src ---

All of our code for the STV and Plurality Algothrims (BallotBox, Candidates, Election) are working currently. 
Testing has been done but there still might be one to two edge cases left, will add to Buglist that is due next week with what we find

GUI also works as intended and we are able to grab all of the files we need. We didnt have time to fully implement the help screen so that is the next step for the new sprint.
We also can't find out how to fully implement the GUI to the election algorthim so having these two parts of our system mesh is still something to work on.

Testing ----

Testing was done as we went along, all test files are currently within our google drive and need to be organized and written up to for Github next week.

Documentation --

Doxygen used for documenatation -- comments have been made in the code.

We will also have adiditonal documentation for our testing next week.
